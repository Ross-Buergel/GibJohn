This is one of the websites I was asked to make during my T Level course. Here is the scenario I was given:

The software development company you work for has secured a new contract to develop a digital solution for GibJohn Tutoring. GibJohn Tutoring currently provides customers with:

• face-to-face tutoring sessions

• access to learning resources

• support to develop understanding in different subjects.

The client (owners of GibJohn Tutoring) would like to develop a digital solution that will:

• provide interactive teaching and learning resources in a range of subjects

• provide access to digital content to encourage wider learning

• support assessment and monitoring of learner progress.


The client has carried out some market research with existing customers and tutors to identify features that could be included in the digital solution. The potential features suggested by the client are:

• collaborative teaching and learning tools

• accessibility features to support a wide range of users

• a learning reward system

• gamified learning.
